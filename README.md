# Django Simple Accounts

## Stop rewriting User views and templates!

Use these views and templates to interact with the `django.contrib.auth.models.User` model. Allow your end users to easily login, logout, register, and manage their profile.

These views and templates are designed to be bear bones, not a lot of bells and whistles here.

Don't get bogged down managing Users, focus on writing your application!
